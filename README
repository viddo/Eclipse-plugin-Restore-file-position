Eclipse plugin, Restore file position
==================

This is a small Eclipse plug-in that saved your position in a document when you close it and restores the editor to the same position when you re-open it again.
Nothing fancy but solves the problem.

Tested working with Eclipse 3.6.1 (Helios) and 3.7 (Indigo) on Mac OS X 10.6.8.

### Installation
 - Open Help menu and click Install New Software
 - Put `http://gummesson.net/eclipse/site.xml` in "Work with:" field and press enter.
 - Select "Restore File Position" in the list.
 - Next etc. and restart. 

### Alternative installation:
 - Download the jar file from `dist` folder (open the jar --> `View Raw`)
 - Drop it into your `dropins` Eclipse directory and restart
